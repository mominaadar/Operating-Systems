What a day!Hello World-This is an interesting lab task-Operating System Lab-Today is Wednesday, April 1st but no April Fool cuz haram-I am loving these days off because I missed my family so much-Corona virus is at its peak. One day when everything goes fine and Ill be done with this semester then Ill randomly look back at my OS-lab data and will find that woah Corona was going on and we were having online classes-I woke up late today so skipped lemon water and had breakfast straight away. Now I am thinking about those people who do not even have lemons to make lemon water from. Who do not have anything to eat especially in this time of crisis where everyone is bound to stay at home and not work. What about the people who used to work on daily wages? How hard it would be for those fathers to be helpless? To them is it their own health important or the hunger of their family? Definitely hunger-In these hard times I am realizing the true power of Allah. Every single person is helpless today. No matter how much rich they are, no matter how much power they have. Today, nothing matters. All that matters is survival and that is again not in our hands-This is the last file so Id make a dua in it. May Allah keep everybody safe, healthy and give them provisions from His own treasures. May no one get to sleep hungry and may no one loses their loved ones. Amen-
